## ASP.NET Core 6
This repository is a port of [Smartstore 4](https://github.com/smartstore/SmartStoreNET) - which is based on the classic .NET Framework 4.7.2 – to the new `ASP.NET Core 6` platform. 

Smartstore instances based on classic `ASP.NET MVC` can be upgraded seamlessly. To perform the upgrade, only the app files need to be replaced on your server - except for the `App_Data` directory - and **all data will be automatically transferred to the new system**. [Detailed information about installing or upgrading](https://github.com/zihniartar/Smartstore-Core-Installation-Linux-Windows) your shop can be found [here](https://github.com/zihniartar/Smartstore-Core-Installation-Linux-Windows).
