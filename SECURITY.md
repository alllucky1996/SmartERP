# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the `master` branch of the application will receive security updates. 
Depending on the issue severity, security updates may or may not be applied to any previously published or released versions.

A new release version of the library will be published, _if required_, to address any security updates.


## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report any _sensitive_, _critical_, or _urgent_ vulnerablities by using <a href="https://smartstore.com/en/contact">our contact form</a> saying 
you need to communicate an important security issue.

After assessing the issue, we will work out how we will handle the matter and let you know how to proceed. If the vulnerablity is neither _sensitive_, _critical_, or _urgent_, 
please just create a <a href="https://github.com/smartstore/Smartstore/issues/new/choose">new issue</a> as per normal.
